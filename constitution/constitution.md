# Constitution of the Republic Reset

---

## Preamble

We, the people, join together to form a just and lasting community.  
We establish this Constitution as our social contract, to protect freedom, dignity, and fairness for all.  
Our government exists only by the consent of the governed, and its purpose is to serve the people, never to rule them.  
With this understanding, we agree to these principles and the laws that follow.

## Article I: The Social Contract

### Section 1. The Foundation of Authority
The authority of the State derives solely from the consent of the governed.  
The State exists to secure the rights, freedoms, and welfare of its people, and no authority may be exercised except in service of this purpose.

### Section 2. Duties of the State
The State shall:
1. Protect the inherent rights and dignity of every person.  
2. Provide for public safety, justice, and the common good.  
3. Act with transparency, accountability, and fairness.

### Section 3. Duties of Citizens
Citizens, in return for the protections and benefits of the State, shall:

2. Uphold the laws of the land, provided those laws meet the standards of clarity established in Article II.  
3. Contribute to the maintenance of the common good, including through lawful taxation and service where required.  

### Section 4. Breach of Contract
When the State persistently fails in its duties, the people retain the right to seek redress through peaceful assembly, petition, lawful reform, and amendment of this Constitution.  
Persistent and systemic breach may constitute grounds for withdrawal of consent, up to and including the reconstitution of government.

### Section 5. Renewal of Consent
The Constitution shall stand as the living expression of this Social Contract.  
Each generation shall have the right to reaffirm, revise, or renew it by the means of amendment and democratic process provided herein.

Ambiguity that prevents a reasonable person from understanding what is permitted, prohibited, or required shall render the law void.

In the event of conflict, the plain-language text shall prevail.

### Section 3. Citizen’s Summary
Every law shall include a concise summary, not exceeding one page, stating:
- The purpose of the law.  
- The rights and obligations it creates.  
- The penalties or remedies it imposes.  

### Section 4. Accessibility of Publication
All laws shall be made publicly available, free of charge, in both physical and digital formats.  
They shall be organized in a manner that permits citizens to easily search, read, and reference them.

### Section 5. Duty of Legislative Clarity
The legislature shall bear responsibility for ensuring clarity.  
Courts shall construe ambiguous provisions against the legislature that enacted them.

### Section 6. Constitutional Linkage
This Article is enacted in fulfillment of the Social Contract (Article I), which obligates the State to ensure clarity, accessibility, and fairness in lawmaking.

### Section 1. Purpose  
No branch of government shall exceed the authority granted to it under this Constitution. The powers of each branch shall be balanced by the others, and the people shall retain ultimate oversight of those who govern in their name.  

---

### Section 2. Legislative and Executive Checks  
The President may veto legislation, returning it with stated objections. The Legislature may override such veto by a two-thirds vote of both chambers. Only the Legislature may declare war, authorize the use of armed force, and approve taxation and spending.

---

### Section 3. Judicial Checks  
The courts may review laws and government actions for compliance with this Constitution, as provided in Article VI.

### Section 4. Citizen Oversight  
Citizens retain the right to petition for constitutional review of any law, regulation, or executive action.

A petition signed by at least five percent of the national electorate shall compel the Legislature to debate and vote on the measure in question. The right of recall shall extend to all elected officials, subject to thresholds defined by law, and to higher standards for the Presidency as provided in Article V. The recall of the President or Vice President shall not trigger a new election but shall instead activate the line of succession.  

---

### Section 5. Transparency and Accountability  
All branches of government shall conduct their business publicly except where secrecy is strictly necessary for national defense or the protection of individual rights. Records of votes, debates, and decisions shall be published promptly in plain language. Obstruction of the petition system, recall process, or other constitutional checks shall itself constitute a breach of this Constitution, subject to judicial remedy and personal accountability for the officials responsible.  

---

### Section 6. Enforcement of Checks  
Refusal by any branch or official to comply with a constitutional check — including veto overrides, judicial rulings, citizen petitions, or recall processes — shall constitute a constitutional violation.  

Officials who engage in such refusal shall be subject to immediate suspension from office pending judicial review. Upon confirmation of violation, the official shall be removed from office. Any official found to have willfully or severely defied a constitutional check shall be permanently barred from holding public office within the Republic.  

Where refusal or collusion is systemic, involving multiple branches or a chamber of the Legislature, the people may initiate a national referendum by petition of not less than ten percent of the electorate. Such referendum may compel compliance with the violated check, recall an entire chamber of the Legislature, or call for reconstitution of government under the provisions of Article I, Section 4.  

The judiciary shall supervise such processes to ensure lawful execution, and the Legislature shall be obligated to enforce compliance by statute or direct action.
