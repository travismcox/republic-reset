# Constitution of the Republic Reset

---

## Preamble

We, the people, join together to form a just and lasting community.  
We establish this Constitution as our social contract, to protect freedom, dignity, and fairness for all.  
Our government exists only by the consent of the governed, and its purpose is to serve the people, never to rule them.  
With this understanding, we agree to these principles and the laws that follow.

## Article I: The Social Contract

### Section 1. The Foundation of Authority

The State shall:
1. Protect the inherent rights and dignity of every person.

### Section 3. Duties of Citizens
Citizens, in return for the protections and benefits of the State, shall:

3. Contribute to the maintenance of the common good, including through lawful taxation and service where required.  

### Section 4. Breach of Contract
When the State persistently fails in its duties, the people retain the right to seek redress through peaceful assembly, petition, lawful reform, and amendment of this Constitution.  
Persistent and systemic breach may constitute grounds for withdrawal of consent, up to and including the reconstitution of government.

### Section 5. Renewal of Consent
The Constitution shall stand as the living expression of this Social Contract.  
Each generation shall have the right to reaffirm, revise, or renew it by the means of amendment and democratic process provided herein.

- The penalties or remedies it imposes.

All laws shall be made publicly available, free of charge, in both physical and digital formats.  
They shall be organized in a manner that permits citizens to easily search, read, and reference them.

### Section 5. Duty of Legislative Clarity
The legislature shall bear responsibility for ensuring clarity.  
Courts shall construe ambiguous provisions against the legislature that enacted them.
